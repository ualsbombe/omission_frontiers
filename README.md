## Synopsis
This project is intended for facilitating group-level analysis in magnetoencephalography (MEG) using the open toolboxes MNE-Python and FieldTrip. The code is accompanied by an article for each of the toolboxes in an upcoming Frontiers Special Issue.  
Intended to be compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, but hasn't been extensively tested for Python 3. Testing was done with 0.15 of MNE-Python 
  
For instructions and context of the code please refer to the article called: Group analysis in MNE-Python of evoked responses from a tactile stimulation paradigm: a pipeline for reproducibility at every step of processing, going from individual sensor space representations to an across-group source space representation  
The DOI is: DOI:10.3389/fnins.2018.00006
  
A similar article for the FieldTrip pipeline is called: Group Analysis in FieldTrip of Time-Frequency Responses: A Pipeline for Reproducibility at Every Step of Processing, Going From Individual Sensor Space Representations to an Across-Group Source Space Representation
The DOI is: DOI:10.3389/fnins.2018.00261

## Motivation
Most tutorials on MEG analysis are at the single-subject level. This is an attempt at remedying that situation by providing a comphehensive collection of functions that can all be accessed from a single pipeline script (MNE-Python) or several pipeline scripts (FieldTrip)

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the scripts and get the data at the following DOI:10.5281/zenodo.998518 or URL:https://zenodo.org/record/998518
